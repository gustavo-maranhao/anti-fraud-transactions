# Anti-Fraud Transaction Detection Model

This project implements a simple anti-fraud transaction detection model using Python. 
The model analyzes transaction data to identify potential fraudulent activities based on predefined rules.

## Project Overview:

1. The database is loaded from a CSV file hosted in the repository (file "database.csv");
2. The BIN* column is created by extracting the first six digits from the card number;
3. The percentage of chargebacks per BIN is calculated and descriptive statistics are displayed;
4. A histogram is plotted to visualize the distribution of chargeback percentages per BIN;
5. The number of unique users per card number and the number of unique card numbers per user are displayed;
6. Descriptive statistics of transaction amounts are displayed grouped by chargeback status;
7. The number of unique users with transaction amounts greater than 1000, chargeback percentage per BIN above 22, and has_cbk set to True are displayed;
8. A histogram is plotted to visualize the distribution of transaction amounts with the chargeback status as the hue;
9. Two functions, has_chargeback and has_chargeback_card, are defined to check if a user or card has had chargebacks in the past;
10. The get_recommendation function applies the predefined rules to determine whether to approve or deny a transaction;
11. A sample transaction is provided, and the model's recommendation is displayed in JSON format;
12. Evaluation metrics, including the confusion matrix and F1 score, are calculated to assess the model's performance.

*BIN (Bank Identification Number):  It refers to the first six digits of a credit or debit card number.The BIN provides essential information about the card's origin, including the bank, country, and card type.

## Notes:

To use this model, simply provide transaction data with relevant fields such as transaction ID, merchant ID, user ID, card number, transaction date, transaction amount, and device ID to the get_recommendation function. The function will return either "approve" or "deny" as the recommendation.

For evaluating the model's performance, the F1 score and confusion matrix are computed using predictions generated by applying the get_recommendation function to the entire dataset.
